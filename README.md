Moti, also known as Pearl, is considered one of the most calming gemstones in Vedic astrology. It is associated with the Moon, which governs emotions, peace of mind, and mental clarity. Wearing a natural Moti gemstone helps in balancing emotions, reducing anger, and bringing inner peace. It is highly recommended for people who face mood swings, stress, or anxiety as it stabilizes the mind. Astrologers also suggest Moti for enhancing creativity, boosting confidence, and strengthening relationships by promoting harmony. Pearl is believed to bring prosperity, good fortune, and better decision-making power. It also benefits those suffering from insomnia or emotional instability. People with a weak Moon in their horoscope are often advised to wear Moti for spiritual and emotional growth. Its cooling energy protects from negative vibes and strengthens family bonds. For best results, a certified and high-quality Pearl should be worn in silver or gold as per astrological guidance.
